# Request Custom Features

When you add custom features to your testing plan, a Customer Success Manager will contact you within 2-7 days to create a personalized quote. This request is not binding—it simply opens a conversation to find the best solution for your needs.


## What Are Custom Features

Custom features are additional requirements beyond your selected template.   
These might include:

- **Technical specifications:** specific browsers, additional test criteria  
- **Participant criteria:** geographic details, specific user segments, service providers  
- **Custom tasks:** different types or quantities of user activities

Adding these features means your project requires personalized evaluation to ensure accurate pricing and realistic timelines.


## How It Works

When you click "Submit" on your activity form, your request enters our review queue.   
Before submitting, you'll see a summary of your modifications and can adjust them if needed.

**Note:** You cannot modify the request after submission, but you can discuss and refine requirements with your CSM.

### 2\. We review your needs

Our team evaluates:

- Project scope and complexity  
- Technical feasibility  
- Resource allocation

**Timeline:** 2-7 days

### 3\. Our team contacts you

### Technical Setup:

Your CSM explains how each factor applies to your project.


## Why This Approach?

**Accuracy:** Custom requirements need human evaluation to provide you with realistic expectations. We prefer to give you accurate information rather than automated estimates that might disappoint later.

**Partnership:** This process ensures you get exactly what you need—no more, no less. Your CSM will work with you to optimize both value and budget.

**Transparency:** You'll understand exactly what you're paying for and why, with no hidden costs or surprises.
